## Title: **Body Movement**

**Description:**
  A app designed to allow the user to log a weight training workout or simply follow a default one.

**App Inspiration:**
  Many trainings apps do not allow you to adjust the number of sets you are working with on the fly. I believe real-time adjustments are very important to weight training as training is dynamic based on how much effort you have left. Also, there is a new metric called RPE which stands for rate of perceived exertion which allows the user to log in how much effort they used for that set. I wanted to incorporate this as well as many training apps don't include this either.

**Technologies Used:**
  HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Express, Ejs, Mongoose, Heroku.

**Getting Started:**

  2. You can either click on "Preset Routine" or "Your Routine" to see workout exercises. Preset routine has a basic starter routine for a beginner. Your Routine will have everything that you add using the Create Exercise (*3rd link in the Nav*).
  3. When you click "Create Exercise", it pre-fills some basic values. You can then adjust them according to your preferences. When you submit it, it will add it to your personal routine.
  4. Your personal routine has features to add or remove sets. You can also delete a particular exercise from your routine completely. In the navigation on *Your Routine* you can edit the existing values of each exercise. There is a lot of control to *Your Routine*.
  5. That is all! Enjoy!
